## Paper Reading
| Name | Author | Year | Reading Style | Date | Description |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Deep learning | LeCun Yann | 2015 | All | 2024-2-21 | Introduction the history of Deep learning and future |
| ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks | Krizhevsky Alex | 2017 | All | 2024-2-25 | Developed a new regularization method -- dropout |
| Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition | Simonyan Karen | 2015 | All | 2024-3-2 | It was found that the existing technology can only support 16-19 weights, and as the number of layers is increased later, the accuracy does not increase but decreases. |
| Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition | He Kaiming | 2015 | All | 2024-3-10 | A residual networks were introduced to solve the problem of vanishing or exploding gradients, allowing us to add more weight layers|
| Going Deeper with Convolutions | Szegedy Christian | 2014 | All | 2024-3-12 | Introduce an inception module which can stack these convolution operations of different scales and utilize parallel convolution to capture multi-scale features|
| Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision | Szegedy Christian | 2015 | All | 2024-3-14 | More exploration on inception module in Neural Networks Architecture side|

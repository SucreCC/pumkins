A long-term study plan for interview,  [based on Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/).


# Plan for Datastructures and Algorithms

According to the Breadth-First preparation, I will roughly go through all the topics and then start practice them via LeetCode.

# Plan for Behaviour Questions
Company are more like to hire a candidates who pay more attention to teamwork, including caring for colleagues and communicating with colleagues, but not a [selfish jerk](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-11-13/brilliant-jerks.html).
:::success
No matter which company you are in, they hope you can be ++smart++{.wavy}, ++creative++{.wavy}, and ++capable of leadership++{.wavy}, but also be obedient and work well. Especially if it’s repetitive work, don’t be particularly competitive and pursue career development.
:::

## STAR format
1. Situation
> The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenge and situation which you found yourself in.
2. Task
> What were you required to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation. Some performance development methods use "Target" rather than "Task". Job interview candidates who describe a "Target" they set themselves instead of an externally imposed "Task" emphasize their own intrinsic motivation to perform and to develop their performance.
3. Action
> What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it, and what the alternatives were.
4. Result
> What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions and what did you learn? What steps did you take to improve after the experience?
